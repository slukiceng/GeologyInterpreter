This Javascript function which can be used to identify USCS class, grain type and estimate Engineering properties for different geological descriptions.

The function accepts a list of dictionaries. These dictionaries must be provided with a 'description' property for the function to correctly identify the material. The function then identified the USCS class, grain type and Engineering properties of the material according to the UK Geological classification system.

The estimation of Engineering properties is not for final design. The properties are estimated using empircal methods and more information on how the properties are derived can be found in the supporting documentation here: https://civils-corp.notion.site/Documentation-George-AI-assistant-67ae6689850c4b6fb00ea09ca8e8bd1c
